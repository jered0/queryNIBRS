#' queryNIBRS: A package for querying NIBRS crime data summaries.
#'
#'This package retrieves data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting
#'  program (UCR) using their Crime Data Explorer (CDE) API.  Both
#'  instance data and summary data from the National Incident Based
#'  Reporting System (NIBRS) can be retrieved.
#'
#' Accessing data will require the use of an API key that can be obtained
#' from \url{https://api.data.gov/signup/}.
#'
#' @section Warning:
#' The API is considered to be in development, so some functions
#'   may not retrieve data or work as advertised.  Some legitimate
#'   queries can return errors.
